# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In our original analysis, we were able to filter our UFO sightings by occurence date. In this challenge, we were able to go more in-depth by allowing users to filter the UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Most users of Dana's webpage will have encountered filters on other webpages such as online shopping sites. However, even if a user has no idea how to filter our data, we have made the procedure fairly straightforward. Simply read the name of the category and enter a specific filter, ie "Enter Date" and "1/10/2010." 

## Summary
The primary drawback of our design is the fact that users don't know exactly what they can filter by. For instance, after attempting to filter the UFO sightings by the date "1/1/2022", the user will realize that no UFO sightings match the entered date. Thus, here are two recommendations for further development. First, Dana should collect more UFO data. Secondly, and most importantly, Dana should develop a method that lets users know how they can filter the data. For example, Dana could add a section to her webpage that lists off all the valid filters for each category, such as "1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010" for the date category. Another method would be to create a drop-down list for each category and have users click on each desired valid filter.
